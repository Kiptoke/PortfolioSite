                    <p>I got bored one day during work and was really into Friday Night Funkin&#39;, so I began thinking about how I could cover this song in chiptune. This is the result. This was made using Famitracker with the FDS addon.</p>

                    <p>Friendlies was part Christmas gift, part self-improvement excercise. I wanted to try more original compositions since most of my work was in VGM covers, thus, I made Friendlies. These are a collection of short 1-minute musical sketches, each of which exemplify a memory I had made with my close friends. All of them were made using Famitracker.</p>

                    <p>Troubled Waters was a 3 month long game development project I did for my game development course in university. I composed the entire score for it, which you can hear here. All of the music except for the main battle theme were composed using Deflemask. The battle theme was made in Famitracker.</p>

                    <p>My first exploration of chiptune and my first cover, I chose Persona 4&#39;s &#34;Heaven&#34; since it is my favorite track in the entire game. I also decided to challenge myself in the cover by strictly limiting myself to the NES&#39;s 2A03 sound card, and no expansions. Made in Famitracker.</p>
