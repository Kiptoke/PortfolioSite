Although it releases later this year, I worked on it as an intern from March - May 2021. As a programming intern, I helped to build the game's internal social media system, reworked parts of the in-game economy and store user interfaces, and also assisted in running user playtesting sessions. I also helped to develop tools for future developers, such as a script converter that converted Google Doc files from the writing team into usable JSON code for use in Unity.",
